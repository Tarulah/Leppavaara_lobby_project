I did this project in a 3D modelling and additive manufacturing class. 
One student in the class did a 3D model of the lobby of Metropolia’s Leppävaara campus and we put it in a VR environment. 
I was the only programmer in this project with two artists. The project was done with Unity (C#) for HTC Vive as our VR platform.
